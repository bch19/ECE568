In client, we initialize SSL object with previous context, bind sbio to the SSL object, and try ssl_connect to the server. 
In server we initialize a new SSL object in every fork, bind sbio to the SSL object and ready to accept SSL connection from client. 
After the connection is established, both client and server check the certificate, if checking certificate is successful, we start ssl_read/ ssl_write in server and client. 
Client will start ssl_write the question, while server will ssl_read the question from the client. When server receives the question, it will use ssl_write to write the answer to the client.
